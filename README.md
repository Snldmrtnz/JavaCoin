## How to Use

### Here's a step-by-step guide on how to run the code:

1. Setup Java Environment:
   - Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from the official Oracle     website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Create a Java Project:
    - Open your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.) and create a new Java project.
  
3. Create GUI Class:
    - Inside your project, create a new Java class file. Copy the provided GUI class code into this file.
4. Download Required Dependencies:
     -  The code utilizes custom classes (GJLabel, GJButton, Account, Wallet, etc.). Make sure you have these classes available or included in your project. If they are not part of the standard Java libraries, you might need to download or copy them.
5. Resolve Imports:
    - Ensure that all necessary imports are resolved. If any import statements show errors, make sure the required libraries are added to your project.
6. Adjust File Paths:
    - The code references a file named "account.txt". Make sure this file exists in your project directory, or you may adjust the file path as needed.
7. Run the Application:
    - Once you've set up everything, simply run the main method in the GUI class. This will launch the Java GUI application, and you should see the graphical interface displayed on your screen.
8. Interact with the GUI:
    - After the GUI application launches, you can interact with it using the provided buttons and input fields. Test out different functionalities such as adding/removing wallets, depositing/withdrawing/transferring funds, and saving progress.
9. Enjoy!
    - Once everything is working as expected, you can use the application as intended. Have fun exploring its features and functionalities!
